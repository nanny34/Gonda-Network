The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is a carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae.
 Until recently, it was only found on the island state of Tasmania, but it has been reintroduced to New South Wales in mainland Australia, with a small breeding population.
 The size of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world, following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936.
 It is related to quolls, and distantly related to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding.
 The Tasmanian devil's large head and neck allow it to generate among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on carrion.

Although devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and defecate together in a communal location.
 Unlike most other dasyurids, the devil thermoregulates effectively, and is active during the middle of the day without overheating.
 Despite its rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. 
Devils are not monogamous. Males fight one another for females, and guard their partners to prevent female infidelity.
 Females can ovulate three times in as many weeks during the mating season, and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during the annual mating season.
